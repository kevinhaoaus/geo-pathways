## My Story

I'm Emma, and I help Australia prepare for climate change! I grew up in regional Victoria and was always curious about why some summers were so much hotter than others.

## What I Do Now

I work at CSIRO analyzing how rainfall patterns are changing across Australia. My research helps farmers plan what crops to grow and helps cities prepare for droughts and floods.

## A Typical Day

- **9am**: Check overnight climate model runs on the supercomputer
- **10am**: Video call with farmers in Queensland about seasonal forecasts  
- **11am**: Analyze rainfall data from weather stations across Australia
- **2pm**: Write a report for government about bushfire weather risks
- **4pm**: Team meeting planning our next research project

## The Best Part

Last month, our team's drought predictions helped farmers in NSW save their cattle by moving them before a severe dry spell hit. It's amazing to see your research making a real difference!

## My Path Here

**Year 12**: Did VCE with Methods, Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science
**University**: Environmental Science at ANU (3 years) - loved the climate units!
**Work experience**: Interned at Bureau of Meteorology during uni holidays
**First job**: Graduate program at CSIRO - they train you while you work

## What I Earn

- **Starting**: $70,000 (graduate program)
- **Now (2 years later)**: $85,000
- **Plus**: Great super, study leave, flexible hours

## Advice for High Schoolers

1. **Take science and maths** - you need them but they're not scary!
2. **Ask questions** - climate science is all about curiosity
3. **Look for work experience** - even one week makes a huge difference
4. **Don't stress about perfect marks** - passion matters more

## Why I Love It

Every day I'm working on one of the biggest challenges facing Australia. Climate change affects everything - farming, cities, wildlife, the economy. As a climate scientist, you're at the center of helping Australia adapt and thrive.

Plus the job security is amazing - climate science is only going to become more important!
