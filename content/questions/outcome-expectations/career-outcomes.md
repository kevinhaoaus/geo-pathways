## Scoring Algorithm

**Outcome Expectations Profile**: Calculate average scores for each outcome dimension

**Research Validation**:
- Based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 2000)
- Validated in STEM career choice research (Î± = 0.85-0.91)
- Predictive validity for career satisfaction (r = 0.52-0.68)
- Cross-cultural validity confirmed across diverse populations

**Interpretation Guidelines**:
- **High Financial Expectations (>5.5)**: Consider career paths with higher earning potential
- **High Social Impact Needs (>6.0)**: Emphasize environmental and societal benefits
- **High Work-Life Balance Needs (>5.5)**: Highlight flexible and remote work options
- **High Intellectual Stimulation (>6.0)**: Focus on research and innovation opportunities
