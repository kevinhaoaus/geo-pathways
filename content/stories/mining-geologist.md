## My Story

G'day! I'm Jake, and I find the minerals that power the world's clean energy transition. I work in the Pilbara finding lithium and rare earth elements for batteries and solar panels.

## What I Do Now

I explore for new mineral deposits using everything from satellite imagery to old-school rock hammers. When we find something valuable, I help plan how to extract it responsibly.

## A Typical Work Day (on site)

- **6am**: Safety briefing and check weather conditions
- **7am**: Drive to remote sampling locations in a 4WD
- **9am**: Collect rock samples and map geological formations  
- **12pm**: Lunch break in the shade (it gets to 45Â°C!)
- **1pm**: Use portable analyzers to test samples for valuable minerals
- **4pm**: Update geological maps and plan tomorrow's work
- **6pm**: Back to camp - gym, dinner, and plan next day

## The Best Part

Last year I discovered a new lithium deposit that will supply batteries for 100,000 electric vehicles! It's incredible knowing your work helps power the clean energy revolution.

## My Path Here

**Year 12**: ATAR wasn't amazing but I loved Earth Science and Geography
**University**: Geology at Curtin (4 years) - the field trips were epic!
**Work experience**: Summer work at small exploration companies
**First job**: Graduate geologist - they train you on everything

## What I Earn (This is why people love mining!)

- **Starting**: $95,000 + allowances
- **Now (3 years later)**: $130,000 + bonuses
- **FIFO perks**: Flights paid, accommodation, meals on site
- **Time off**: 2 weeks on, 1 week off rotation

## The FIFO Lifestyle

**Pros**: Great money, forced savings, adventure, tight work friendships
**Cons**: Away from family/friends, remote locations, physical work
**Perfect for**: Young people who want to travel and save money fast

## Skills You Need

- **Physical fitness** - lots of walking and outdoor work
- **Problem-solving** - reading the landscape like a detective  
- **Teamwork** - you depend on your crew in remote areas
- **Tech skills** - GPS, geological software, data analysis

## Advice for Students

1. **Don't worry about perfect marks** - mining companies train you
2. **Get your driver's license** - essential for this work
3. **Try rock climbing or bushwalking** - builds relevant skills
4. **Visit a mine** - most have school tour programs

- **Travel opportunities** - work in amazing remote locations
- **Job security** - Australia's mining industry is world-leading
- **Environmental impact** - modern mining is increasingly sustainable
- **Global importance** - minerals are essential for technology and clean energy

## The Future

Mining is changing fast - we use drones, AI, and robotics now. But you still need geologists to find the deposits and understand the Earth. It's a perfect mix of high-tech and hands-on work.

*"If you like the outdoors, good money, and want to help supply the materials for our clean energy future, mining geology could be perfect for you!"*
