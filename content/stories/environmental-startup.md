## My Story

Hi! I'm Priya, and I started a company that uses AI to help Australian councils reduce carbon emissions. We've helped 20+ councils cut their emissions by 30% on average!

## What My Company Does

GreenSense Technologies creates smart software that analyzes council operations - from waste collection routes to building energy use - and finds ways to cut emissions while saving money.

## A Typical Day (Entrepreneur Life!)

- **7am**: Coffee and check overnight data from our client councils
- **8am**: Team standup meeting - what's everyone working on today?
- **9am**: Call with potential new client (council in regional NSW)
- **11am**: Product demo for investors interested in our Series A
- **1pm**: Work on code with our tech team (yes, I still code!)
- **3pm**: Meeting with government about sustainability grants
- **5pm**: Networking event with other Melbourne startups
- **Evening**: Usually working late, but I love what I do!

## How We Started

My co-founder Tom and I met at Monash studying environmental engineering. We kept seeing councils struggling with emissions targets, so we built software to help them. Started in Tom's garage in 2021!

## The Numbers (Startup Life is Wild!)

**Year 1**: $0 revenue, living on savings and Centrelink
**Year 2**: $50,000 revenue, still eating instant noodles  
**Year 3 (now)**: $400,000 revenue, proper salaries!
**Funding raised**: $1.2 million from Australian VCs
**Team**: Started with 2 people, now we're 8

## What I Earn Now

- **Salary**: $120,000 (could be higher but reinvesting in company)
- **Equity**: Own 35% of company (potentially worth millions if we exit)
- **Perks**: Flexibility, amazing team, working on climate solutions

## My Path Here

**High School**: Good at maths and science, did environmental science unit
**University**: Environmental Engineering at Monash (4 years)
**MBA**: Part-time while working (2 years) - learned business skills
**Before startup**: Worked at consulting firm for 3 years, saved money

## Skills That Matter Most

1. **Problem-solving** - finding solutions councils actually want
2. **Communication** - explaining complex tech to non-technical people  
3. **Resilience** - startups are 90% rejection and 10% success
4. **Technical skills** - I can code and understand the engineering
5. **Leadership** - building and motivating a team

## The Hardest Parts

- **Uncertainty** - never knowing if next month will be profitable
- **Rejection** - most potential clients and investors say no
- **Long hours** - especially in early days
- **Responsibility** - people depend on you for their jobs

## The Best Parts

- **Impact** - our software has prevented 50,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions!
- **Innovation** - building something that didn't exist before  
- **Team** - working with brilliant, passionate people
- **Flexibility** - I set my own schedule and direction
- **Potential** - if we succeed, could be worth tens of millions

## Advice for Future Entrepreneurs

1. **Start with a real problem** - don't build solutions looking for problems
2. **Talk to customers constantly** - they'll tell you what to build
3. **Learn to code** - even basic skills help you understand tech
4. **Build your network** - go to startup events, join accelerators
5. **Save money first** - you'll need runway to survive the early days

## Why Environmental Tech is Hot Right Now

- **Government support** - grants and policies supporting clean tech
- **Market demand** - every organization needs to cut emissions
- **Investor interest** - VCs are pouring money into climate solutions  
- **Global opportunity** - successful Australian companies can export worldwide
- **Personal fulfillment** - you're solving the climate crisis while building wealth

## The Future

We're expanding to help businesses (not just councils) cut emissions. Goal is to be Australia's leading emissions reduction platform. Maybe an IPO in 5 years, or acquisition by a big tech company!

*"If you care about the environment and love solving problems, consider starting a climate tech company. Australia has amazing support for entrepreneurs, and the climate crisis needs innovative solutions. You could build the next Atlassian while saving the planet!"*
