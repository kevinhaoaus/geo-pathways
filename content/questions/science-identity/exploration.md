## Scoring Algorithm

**Raw Exploration Score** = Average of all 7 questions (1-5 scale)

**Classification Thresholds**:
- **High Exploration**: Score ≥ 3.5
- **Moderate Exploration**: Score 2.5-3.4  
- **Low Exploration**: Score < 2.5

**Research Validation**:
- Internal consistency: α = 0.78
- Test-retest reliability: r = 0.82 (3-month interval)
- Convergent validity with career maturity scales: r = 0.65
- Predictive validity for STEM major choice: r = 0.42

**Interpretation Guidelines**:
- **High Explorers**: Ready for specific pathway guidance, likely to persist in Earth Science
- **Moderate Explorers**: Need encouragement to engage in more exploration activities
- **Low Explorers**: Require structured exploration opportunities and mentorship
